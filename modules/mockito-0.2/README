# Play Mockito module

Mockito is slightly incompatible with Play, for two reasons:

* Mockito caches classes, causing class cast exceptions when play reloads them after modification.
* Mockito uses a classloader to find the MockitoConfiguration class, that does not find source java files as used in Play.

This plugin solves those problems by:

* Shipping a minimally modified mockito in which you can disable the cache.
* Shipping a compiled MockitoConfiguration class that will be found by Mockito.

Hopefully, the patch for the first issue will be accepted upstream, so that this plugin no longer needs to ship a modified Mockito in the future.
