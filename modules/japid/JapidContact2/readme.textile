2013-08-06: using dependencies.yml to reference Japid hosted on github


This sample app uses the newly introduced JapidController2 which is more "agile" than the old way of using Japid with Play 1.2.x. 

The main difference:

1. All controllers inherit from JapidController2. 
2. The japid views are now located in the japidroot directory in the application root. 


h2. How to run:

1. "play deps" to get the required libraries. 
2. "play run"
