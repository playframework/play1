h1. How to add project documentation

*Welcome to your project documentation page.*

You can edit it in @documentation@ folder of your project using "textile":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textile_%28markup_language%29 markup.

Every textile file in documentation folder will automatically be added to your documentation index. Just make sure you start it with some @h1.@ header, as it's being used as chapter name.

You can customize the way it looks by editing @template.html@ file, but it's not mandatory so you can remove this file if plain black on white page is ok for you.

h2. Export documentation to htmls

If you want to export your documentation just execute @play doc:export@ command in project root. This will generate zip file in @documentation@ folder with all your textile files rendered to html and files from @images@ and @files@ included.
