~ auto-test -- Automatically run all application tests
~ 
~ Synopsis:
~ ~~~~~~~~~
~ play auto-test [app_path] [--deps]
~
~ Description:
~ ~~~~~~~~~~~~
~ Run the application hosted at the app_path directory, run a web browser and run all application tests.
~ If app_path is omitted, the current directory is used. The application is run in foreground in the current shell. 
~ You can then stop it using Ctrl+C.
~
~ The System.out stream is redirected to the logs/system.out file. All application and framework logs are written to
~ the test-results/application.log file.
~
~ The script first tries to locate the java command using the $JAVA_HOME environment variable (from $JAVA_HOME/bin).
~ If the $JAVA_HOME variable is not defined, the default java command available from the PATH is used.
~
~ All options specified after the application path are passed to the JVM (example. -Xms64m -Xmx256m).
~ All the shell environment variables are passed to the JVM.
~
~ The script tries to run a browser using the OS default registred web browser. If the application has compilation
~ errors, the script fail without trying to launch the browser.
~
~ All test results are written to the test-results/ directory. If all tests pass, a test-results/result.passed file is
~ created. If one or more tests fail, a test-results/result.failed file is created.
~
~ All the test-results/* content is deleted before running the tests.
~
~ This script is intended to be used in continuous integration environments.
~
~ Options:
~ ~~~~~~~~~
~ --deps: 
~ Resolve and install dependencies before running the command.
