~ clean -- Delete temporary files (including the bytecode cache)
~ 
~ Synopsis:
~ ~~~~~~~~~
~ play clean [app_path]
~
~ Description:
~ ~~~~~~~~~~~~
~ Delete the application's tmp directory hosted at the app_path directory.
~ If app_path is omitted, the current directory is used. 
~
~ The tmp directory of any application contains the compiled bytecode cache, used to
~ speed up application start. If you feel that the Play compiler do weird things you can try
~ to clean it and restart your application.
~
~ Tip:
~ ~~~~
~ As alternative, you can use the clean,run command that do the same but automatically run the cleaned application.
