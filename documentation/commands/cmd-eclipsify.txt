~ eclipsify -- Create all Eclipse configuration files
~
~ Alias:

~ ec
~
~ Synopsis:
~ ~~~~~~~~~
~ play eclipsify [app_path] [--deps] [--%fwk_id]
~
~ Description:
~ ~~~~~~~~~~~~
~ Create all needed configuration file to make the application hosted at the app_path directory an Eclipse project.
~ If app_path is omitted, the current directory is used.
~
~ All needed configuration files including .project and .classpath are created.
~ Several launchers for the application are created as well. The main launcher in usable either with the Run and
~ Debug Eclipse command. The JPDA launcher is only usable with the Run command since it already starts a JPDA agent.
~ You can then use the Connect JPDA launcher to start a debugging session at any time. Stopping the debugging session
~ will not stop the server.
~
~ Use File/Import/General/Existing project to import the project into Eclipse.
~
~ Use eclipsify again when you want to update Eclipse configuration files. It's needed after any classpath change.
~ However, it's often better to delete and re-import the project into your workspace since Eclipse keeps dirty caches...
~
~ The created configuration file contains absolute references to your application, the Play framework and all enabled modules.
~ These are specific to your own installation. When you work in a team, each developer must keep his IDE configuration files private.
~
~ Options:
~ ~~~~~~~~~
~ --deps: 
~ Resolve and install dependencies before running the command.
~
~ --%fwk_id:
~ Use this ID to run the application (override the default framework ID)
~
