~ Name:

~ precompile -- Precompile all Java sources and templates to speed up application start-up
~ 
~ Synopsis:
~ ~~~~~~~~~
~ play precompile [app_path] [--deps] [--%fwk_id]
~
~ Description:
~ ~~~~~~~~~~~~
~ Compile the application hosted at the app_path directory. If app_path is omitted, the current directory is used.
~
~ Compilation is done in PROD mode. Any compilation errors are displayed and the process fails. Bytecode is written to
~ the tmp/bytecode/PROD directory.
~
~ Note that with Play, this step is totally optional. It just speeds up the start-up process. You can precompile an application
~ before sending it to the production server.
~
~ Options:
~ ~~~~~~~~~
~ --deps: 
~ Resolve and install dependencies before running the command.
~
~ --%fwk_id:
~ Use this ID to run the application (override the default framework ID)
