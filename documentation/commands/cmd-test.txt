~ Name:
~ ~~~~~
~ test -- Run the application in test mode in the current shell
~ 
~ Synopsis:
~ ~~~~~~~~~
~ play test [app_path] [--deps] [-f] [--java_options]
~
~ Description:
~ ~~~~~~~~~~~~
~ Run the application hosted at the app_path directory. If app_path is omitted, the current directory is used.
~ The application is run in foreground in the current shell. You can then stop it using Ctrl+C.
~
~ The application is run in test mode: the framework ID is forced to 'test' (unless you specify it to be
~ something matching 'test-?.*', e.g 'test-special') and a web test runner is automatically
~ started at the /@tests URL.
~ (Note that when using special test framework ID you have to make sure all test-settings in 
~ application.conf is available with this special framework ID)
~
~ The script first tries to locate the java command using the $JAVA_HOME environment variable (from $JAVA_HOME/bin).
~ If the $JAVA_HOME variable is not defined, the default java command available from the PATH is used.
~
~ All options specified after the application path are passed to the JVM (example. -Xms64m -Xmx256m).
~ All the shell environment variables are passed to the JVM.
~
~ A JPDA session is automatically opened on the port specified by the conf/application.conf file's jpda.port property
~ file (default to 8000). If the JPDA port is already used, another available port is automatically chosen.
~
~ Options:
~ ~~~~~~~~~
~ -f: 
~ Disable the JPDA port checking and force the jpda.port value.
~
~ --deps: 
~ Resolve and install dependencies before running the command.
