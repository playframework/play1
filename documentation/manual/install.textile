h1. Installation guide


h2. <a>Prerequisites</a>

To run the Play framework, you need "Java 5 or later":http://java.sun.com. If you wish to build Play from source, you will need the "Git source control client":http://git-scm.com/ to fetch the source code and "Ant":http://ant.apache.org/ to build it.

p(note). If you are using MacOS, Java is just built-in. If you are using Linux, make sure to use either the Sun-JDK or OpenJDK (and not gcj which is the default Java command on many Linux distros). If you are using Windows, just download and install the latest JDK package.

Be sure to have Java in the current path (enter **java -version** to check). Play will use the default Java or the one available at the **$JAVA_HOME** path if defined.

The *play* command line utility uses Python. So it should work out of the box on any UNIX system (however it requires at least Python 2.5). If you’re running Windows, don’t worry, a Python runtime is bundled with the framework.


h2. <a>Download the binary package</a>

Download the latest "Play binary package":http://download.playframework.org/ and extract the archive. For convenience, you should add the framework installation directory to your system PATH. If you’re on UNIX, make sure that the *play* script is runnable (otherwise simply do a **chmod +x play**). That’s all.

p(note). *Tip*
 
If you need to rebuild the framework for some reason, run **ant** in the **$PLAY_HOME/framework/** directory.


h2. <a>Build from the latest sources</a>

To benefit from the latest improvements and bug fixes, you may want to compile Play from sources. You’ll need a "Git client":http://git-scm.com/ to fetch the sources and "Ant":http://ant.apache.org/ to build the framework.

From the command line:

bc. # git clone git://github.com/playframework/play.git
# cd play/framework
# ant

The Play framework is ready to use.


h2. <a>Using the play command</a>

When the framework is correctly installed, open a shell and execute *play*. 

bc. $ play

You should see the play default message:

!images/help!

You can get more help on any specific command using *play help any-command-name-here*. For example, try:

bc. # play help run

h2. <a>Creating a new application</a>

Use the **new** command to create a new application. You must give a non-existent path where the application will be created.

bc. # play new myApp

!images/guide1-1!

Will create a new application. Start it with:

bc. # play run myApp

You can then open a browser at "http://localhost:9000":http://localhost:9000 and see the default page for the application.
