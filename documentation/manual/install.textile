h1. Installation guide


h2. <a>Prerequisites</a>

To run the play framework, you need "Java 5 or later":http:java.sun.com. If you wish to build play from source, you will need the "Bazaar source control client":http:bazaar-vcs.org/ to fetch the source code and "Ant":http:ant.apache.org/ to build it.

The play command line utility uses python. So it should work out of the box on any UNIX system. If you're running Windows, don't worry, a python runtime is bundled with the framework.


h2. <a>Download the binary package</a>

Download the latest "play binary package":http:www.playframework.org/download and extract the archive. For convenience, you should add the framework installation directory to your system PATH. If you're on UNIX, make sure that the _play_ script is runnable (otherwise simply do a **chmod +x play**). That's all.

p(note). *Tip*
 
If you need to rebuild the framework for whatever reason, run *ant* from the *$PLAY_HOME/framework* directory.


h2. <a>Build from the latest sources</a>

To benefit from the latest improvements and bug fixes, you may want to compile play from sources. You'll need a "Bazaar client":http:bazaar-vcs.org/Download to fetch the sources and "Ant":http:ant.apache.org/ to build the framework.

From the command line :

bc. # bzr checkout lp:play
# cd play/framework
# ant

The Play framework is ready to use.

p(note). lp:play currently aliases to http:bazaar.launchpad.net/%7Eplay-developers/play/1.0/


h2. <a>Use the play command</a>

When the framework is correctly installed, open a shell and execute *play*. 

bc. $ play

You should see the play default message:

!images/help!

You can get more help on any specific command using *play help any-command-name-here*. For example, try:

bc. # play help run


h2. <a>Create a new application</a>

Use the **new** command to create a new application. You must give a non-existent path where the application will be created.

bc. # play new myApp

!images/guide1-1!

Will create a new application. Start it with : 

bc. # play run myApp

You can then open a browser at "http://localhost:9000":http://localhost:9000 and see the default page for the application.

p(note). **Your play environnement is ready**
