The following sections provide more informations about the most important libraries.

h2. Parsing XML using XPath

XPath is probably the easiest way to parse an XML document without having to use code generation tools. The @play.libs.XPath@ library offer all the needed primitives to efficiently achieve this task.

The @XPath@ operations operate on all @org.w3.dom.Node@ types:

bc. org.w3.dom.Document xmlDoc = … // retrieve a Document somewhere
  
for(Node event: XPath.selectNodes("events//event", xmlDoc)) {
    
    String name = XPath.selectText("name", event);
    String data = XPath.selectText("@date", event);
    
    for(Node place: XPath.selectNodes("//place", event)) {
        String place = XPath.selectText("@city", place);
        …
    }
    
    …
}

h2. Web Service client

The @play.libs.WS@ provides a powerful HTTP client. Under the hood it uses "Async HTTP client":https://github.com/AsyncHttpClient/async-http-client. 

Making a request is easy:

bc. HttpResponse res = WS.url("http://www.google.com").get();

Once you have an @HttpResponse@ object you can access all the response properties.

bc. int status = res.getStatus();
String type = res.getContentType();

You can also retrieve the body content in several content types:

bc. String content = res.getString();
Document xml = res.getXml();
JsonElement json = res.getJson();
InputStream is = res.getStream();

You can also use the *async* API to make HTTP requests in a non-blocking way. Then you will receive a @Promise<HttpResponse>@. Once redeem, you can use the @HttpResponse@ as usual:

bc. Promise<HttpResponse> futureResponse = WS.url(
    "http://www.google.com"
).getAsync();

h2. Functional programming with Java

The @play.libs.F@ library provide several useful constructs coming from functional programming. These constructs are used to handle complex abstraction cases. For those that are accustomed to functional programming we provide:

* Option<T> (a T value that can be or not set)
* Either<A,B> (contains either a A value or a B value)
* Tuple<A,B> (contains both A and B values)

h3. Promises

@Promise@ is the Play's custom @Future@ type. In fact a @Promise<T>@ is also a @Future<T>@ so you can use it as a standard @Future@. But it has also a very interesting property: the ability to register callback using @onRedeem(…)@ that will be called as soon as the promised value is available. 

Promises are used everywhere in Play in place of Future (for Jobs, WS.async, etc…).

Promises can be combined in several way. For example:

bc. Promise p = Promise.waitAll(p1, p2, p3)
Promise p = Promise.waitAny(p1, p2, p3)
Promise p = Promise.waitEither(p1, p2, p3)

h3. Pattern Matching

Several times we've felt that we needed pattern matching in Java. Unfortunately Java has not built-in pattern matching, and because of the lack of function, it is difficult to add it as a library. Anyway we've worked on a solution that is not so bad.

Our idea was to use the latest 'for loop' syntax to achieve basic pattern matching for Java. Pattern matching must both check if your object matches the required conditions and extract the interesting value. The Pattern matching library for Play is part of the @play.libs.F@ library.

Let's see a simple example; you have a reference of type Object and you want to check that it is a string that starts by "command:". 

The standard way would be:

bc. Object o = anything();
 
if(o instanceof String && ((String)o).startsWith("command:")) {
    String s = (String)o;
    System.out.println(s.toUpperCase());
}

Using the Play pattern matching library, you can write it as:

bc. for(String s: String.and(StartsWith("command:")).match(o)) {
    System.out.println(s.toUpperCase());
}

The for loop is executed once, only if the condition is met, and it automatically extracts the String value without the need of casting. Because there is no explicit cast, all this thing is type safe, and checked by the compiler.

h2. OAuth

"OAuth":http://oauth.net/ is an open protocol to allow secure API authorization in a simple and standard method from desktop and web applications.

Two different specifications exist: OAuth 1.0 and OAuth 2.0. Play provides libraries to connect as a consumer to services proposing either of these specifications.

The general process is the following:
* Redirect the user to the authorization page of the provider
* After the user grants authorization, he is redirected back to your server along with an unauthorized token
* Your server exchanges the unauthorized token with an access token specific to the current user, that needs to be saved in order to perform requests to the service. This step is done as a server-to-server communication.

The Play framework will take care of most of the process.

h3. <a>OAuth 1.0</a>

The OAuth 1.0 functionality is provided by the **play.libs.OAuth** class and is based on "oauth-signpost":http://code.google.com/p/oauth-signpost/. It is used by services such as "Twitter":http://apiwiki.twitter.com/ or "Google":http://code.google.com/apis/accounts/docs/OAuth.html

To connect to a service, you need the create a OAuth.ServiceInfo instance using the
following information, obtained from the service provider:
* Request token URL
* Access token URL
* Authorize URL
* Consumer key
* Consumer secret

The access token can be retrieved this way:

bc. public static void authenticate() {
    // TWITTER is a OAuth.ServiceInfo object
    // getUser() is a method returning the current user 
    if (OAuth.isVerifierResponse()) {
        // We got the verifier; 
        // now get the access tokens using the unauthorized tokens
        TokenPair tokens = OAuth.service(TWITTER).requestAccessToken(
            getUser().getTokenPair()
        );
        // let's store them and go back to index
        getUser().setTokenPair(tokens);
        index();
    }
    OAuth twitt = OAuth.service(TWITTER);
    TokenPair tokens = twitt.requestUnauthorizedToken();
    // We received the unauthorized tokens 
    // we need to store them before continuing
    getUser().setTokenPair(tokens);
    // Redirect the user to the authorization page
    redirect(twitt.redirectUrl(tokens));
}

Then, call can be done by signing the requests using the token pair:
bc. mentions = WS.url(url).oauth(TWITTER, getUser().getTokenPair()).get().getString();

The full example usage is available in **samples-and-tests/twitter-oauth**.

h3. <a>OAuth 2.0</a>

OAuth 2.0 is much simpler that OAuth 1.0 because it doesn't involve signing requests. It is used by "Facebook":http://developers.facebook.com/docs/authentication/ and "37signals":http://37signals.com

Functionality is provided by **play.libs.OAuth2**.

To connect to a service, you need the create a OAuth2 instance using the following information, obtained from the service provider:
* Access token URL
* Authorize URL
* Client ID
* Secret

bc. public static void auth() {
    // FACEBOOK is a OAuth2 object
    if (OAuth2.isCodeResponse()) {
        String access_token = FACEBOOK.getAccessToken();
        // Save access_token, you will need it to request the service
        index();
    }
    FACEBOOK.requestAccessToken(); // This will trigger a redirect
}

Once you have the access token associated with the current user, you can use it to query the service on behalf of the user:

bc. WS.url(
    "https://graph.facebook.com/me?access_token=%s", access_token
).get().getJson();

The full example usage is available in **samples-and-tests/facebook-oauth2**.


h2. OpenID

"OpenID":http://openid.net/ is an open and decentralized identity system. You can easily accept new users in your application without having to keep specific user information. You just have to keep track of authorized users through their **OpenID**.

This example provides a high-level view of how OpenID authentication can be used within a Play application:

* For each request, check if the user is connected
* If not, display a page where the user can submit his OpenID
* Redirect the user to the OpenID provider
* When the user comes back, get the verified OpenID and save it in the HTTP session.

The OpenID functionality is provided by the **play.libs.OpenID** class.

bc. @Before(unless={"login", "authenticate"})
static void checkAuthenticated() {
    if(!session.contains("user")) {
        login();
    }
}
 
public static void index() {
    render("Hello %s!", session.get("user"));
}
     
public static void login() {
    render();
}
    
public static void authenticate(String user) {
    if(OpenID.isAuthenticationResponse()) {
        UserInfo verifiedUser = OpenID.getVerifiedID();
        if(verifiedUser == null) {
            flash.error("Oops. Authentication has failed");
            login();
        } 
        session.put("user", verifiedUser.id);
        index();
    } else {
        if(!OpenID.id(user).verify()) { // will redirect the user
            flash.error("Cannot verify your OpenID");
            login();
        } 
    }
}

And the **login.html** template:

bc. #{if flash.error}
<h1>${flash.error}</h1>
#{/if}
 
<form action="@{Application.authenticate()}" method="POST">
    <label for="user">What’s your OpenID?</label>
    <input type="text" name="user" id="user" />
    <input type="submit" value="login..." />
</form>
</code>

And finally the routes definitions:

bc. GET   /                     Application.index
GET   /login                Application.login
*     /authenticate         Application.authenticate
