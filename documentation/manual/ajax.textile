h1. Ajax in the Play framework

The Play framework allows you to easily perform Ajax requests, and is shipped with "jQuery":http://jquery.com by default. This section describes how to effectively use "jQuery":http://jquery.com within the framework.

The Play framework also comes with the handy @jsAction@ tag to transparently get a method definition from the controller.

h2. <a name="jsaction">Using jQuery with the jsAction tag</a>

The @#{jsAction /}@ tag returns a JavaScript function which constructs a URL based on a server action and free variables. It does not perform an AJAX request; these have to be done by hand using the returned URL.

Let's see an example:

bc. GET     /hotels/list        Hotels.list

Now you can import this route client side:

bc. <script type="text/javascript">
   var listAction = #{jsAction @list(':search', ':size', ':page') /}
   $('#result').load(
       listAction({search: 'x', size: '10', page: '1'}), 
       function() {
           $('#content').css('visibility', 'visible')
       }
   )
</script>

In this example we are requesting the list method from the default Application controller. We are also passing three parameters: search, size and page. The request we perform is then saved into the listAction variable. Now using jQuery and the @load@ function we are performing a request (an HTTP GET request in fact).

In fact, the following request is sent:

bc. GET /hotels/list?search=x&size=10&page=1

In that case the request returns HTML data.

However, it is also possible to return JSON or XML and to have jQuery interpret the data. In your controller, use the appropriate render method (renderJSON, renderXML or an XML template).

Please refer to the "jQuery":http://docs.jquery.com/Main_Page documentation for more info.

Also please note that we could perform a POST; the jQuery method should then be changed to:

bc. $.post(listAction, function(data) {
  $('#result').html(data);
});
