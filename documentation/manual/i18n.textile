h1. Setting up i18n

Internationalization is a means of adapting your application to different languages to allow for regional differences. Follow these steps to enable internationalization in your application.

h2. <a>Only use UTF-8!</a>

Play supports only one encoding: UTF-8. Since encoding problems can be weird and difficult to deal with, we made the choice to support only one encoding. UTF-8 allows you to display all characters for all languages.

Be sure to be consistent with UTF-8 usage throughout your application:

* Edit all your source files as UTF-8
* Define proper encoding headers in HTTP
* Set your HTML meta tags to UTF-8
* If you use a database, configure it to use UTF-8, and always connect to it using UTF-8

p(note). **Note**
 
The UTF-8 encoding issue is the reason why most of the Play configuration files, even though they are Java properties files, are not named *.properties. Java imposes the requirement that properties files must be encoded with **iso-8859-1**. Play configuration files must be UTF-8 encoded. Need we say more?

h2. <a>Externalize your messages</a>

To support i18n you have to externalize all messages in your application. 

Create a file named **messages** in the application’s **conf/** directory. This file is really just a Java properties file.

bc. hello=Hello!
back=Back

Then you can define a specific **message** file for each language used in your application. Just add the ISO language code as a file extension. 

For example, the message file containing the corresponding French translations is **conf/messages.fr**:

bc. hello=Bonjour!
back=Retour

h2. <a>Define languages supported by the application</a>

In the **conf/application.conf** file, define a list of supported languages:

bc. application.langs=fr,en,ja

On the first request from a new user, Play will guess the default language to use. It does so by parsing the HTTP **Accept-language** header. It will then save the chosen language in a **PLAY_LANG** cookie. So the next request will use the same language.

From your application code your can retrieve the current language for the user by accessing the **play.i18n.Lang** object:

bc. String lang = Lang.get();

If you want to permanently change the user language, use the change() method:

bc. Lang.change("ja");

The new value will be saved back to the user’s language cookie.

h2. <a>Define date format according to your locale</a>

To set the default date format to use, edit your application.conf and set the following property:

bc. date.format=yyy-MM-dd
    date.format.fr=dd/MM/yyyy

Please note that the language fr in the application.conf must be enabled as well (see above):
bc. application.langs=fr,en

This property affects how the dates are rendered in the templates using the ${date.format()}.
It also set the default date format when binding a date parameter.

h2. <a>Retrieve localized messages</a>

From the application code, you can retrieve messages defined in message files. From Java, use the **play.i18n.Messages** object.

bc. public static void hello() {
    renderText(Messages.get("hello"));
}

We support message formatting through the standard Java formatting syntax. You can also define dynamic content in your messages:

bc. hello=Hello %s!

and

bc. public static void hello(String user) {
    renderText(Messages.get("hello", user));
}

From a template you can use the special **&{…}** syntax to display localized messages:

bc. <h1>&{'hello'}</h1>

or using dynamic content:

bc. <h1>&{'hello', params.user}</h1>
