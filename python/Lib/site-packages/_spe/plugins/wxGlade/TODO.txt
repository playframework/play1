  those to keep as is, when updating an existing file

- Investigation of the many memory leaks

- separation between window objects and sizer ones in the generated code 

- Code generation from the command line, witout starting the GUI

- support wxWindows xml resources (XRC) through a code generator

- support for C++ code generation

- Possibility to change the type of a sizer after its creation
 
- Possibility to change the position of a widget inside its sizer

- Edit -> Preferences... to customize some aspects of wxGlade

- International characters support

- Grid

- Auto saving/backup of wxg files (and possibly also of generated sources)

- Import of "wxGlade-friendly" XRC files

- Preview of toplevel widgets

  see the tutorial)

- Event handlers support

- ListCtrl and TreeCtrl (#: need to add more properties)

- ToolBar for frames (#: no controls yet)

- complete MenuBar with icons and StatusBar messages support (#)

- Less frequently used controls

- on-line help (with wxHtmlHelpController)

- test of the various modules with unittest (this might come earlier...)

- gettext support (#: done for code generation, todo for wxGlade itself)

- ``Templates'' for particular windows (for example, something as a dialog with
  an image, a centered label and a couple of buttons)

- TabOrder property (this may be hard though)

- (Maybe) Java code generator

- ...
