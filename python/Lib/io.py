"""
The io module provides the Python interfaces to stream handling. The
builtin open function is defined in this module.

At the top of the I/O hierarchy is the abstract base class IOBase. It
defines the basic interface to a stream. Note, however, that there is no
seperation between reading and writing to streams; implementations are
allowed to throw an IOError if they do not support a given operation.

Extending IOBase is RawIOBase which deals simply with the reading and
writing of raw bytes to a stream. FileIO subclasses RawIOBase to provide
an interface to OS files.

BufferedIOBase deals with buffering on a raw byte stream (RawIOBase). Its
subclasses, BufferedWriter, BufferedReader, and BufferedRWPair buffer
streams that are readable, writable, and both respectively.
BufferedRandom provides a buffered interface to random access
streams. BytesIO is a simple stream of in-memory bytes.

Another IOBase subclass, TextIOBase, deals with the encoding and decoding
of streams into text. TextIOWrapper, which extends it, is a buffered text
interface to a buffered raw stream (`BufferedIOBase`). Finally, StringIO
is a in-memory stream for text.

Argument names are not part of the specification, and only the arguments
of open() are intended to be used as keyword arguments.

data:

DEFAULT_BUFFER_SIZE

   An int containing the default buffer size used by the module's buffered
   I/O classes. open() uses the file's blksize (as obtained by os.stat) if
   possible.

def open(file, mode="r", buffering=None, encoding=None, errors=None,
         newline=None, closefd=True):
    r"""Open file and return a stream. If the file cannot be opened, an IOError is
    raised.

    file is either a string giving the name (and the path if the file
    isn't in the current working directory) of the file to be opened or an
    integer file descriptor of the file to be wrapped. (If a file
    descriptor is given, it is closed when the returned I/O object is
    closed, unless closefd is set to False.)

    mode is an optional string that specifies the mode in which the file
    is opened. It defaults to 'r' which means open for reading in text
    mode.  Other common values are 'w' for writing (truncating the file if
    it already exists), and 'a' for appending (which on some Unix systems,
    means that all writes append to the end of the file regardless of the
    current seek position). In text mode, if encoding is not specified the
    encoding used is platform dependent. (For reading and writing raw
    bytes use binary mode and leave encoding unspecified.) The available
    modes are:

    ========= ===============================================================
    Character Meaning
    --------- ---------------------------------------------------------------
    'r'       open for reading (default)
    'w'       open for writing, truncating the file first
    'a'       open for writing, appending to the end of the file if it exists
    'b'       binary mode
    't'       text mode (default)
    '+'       open a disk file for updating (reading and writing)
    'U'       universal newline mode (for backwards compatibility; unneeded
              for new code)
    ========= ===============================================================

    The default mode is 'rt' (open for reading text). For binary random
    access, the mode 'w+b' opens and truncates the file to 0 bytes, while
    'r+b' opens the file without truncation.

    Python distinguishes between files opened in binary and text modes,
    even when the underlying operating system doesn't. Files opened in
    binary mode (appending 'b' to the mode argument) return contents as
    bytes objects without any decoding. In text mode (the default, or when
    't' is appended to the mode argument), the contents of the file are
    returned as strings, the bytes having been first decoded using a
    platform-dependent encoding or using the specified encoding if given.

    buffering is an optional integer used to set the buffering policy. By
    default full buffering is on. Pass 0 to switch buffering off (only
    allowed in binary mode), 1 to set line buffering, and an integer > 1
    for full buffering.

    encoding is the name of the encoding used to decode or encode the
    file. This should only be used in text mode. The default encoding is
    platform dependent, but any encoding supported by Python can be
    passed.  See the codecs module for the list of supported encodings.

    errors is an optional string that specifies how encoding errors are to
    be handled---this argument should not be used in binary mode. Pass
    'strict' to raise a ValueError exception if there is an encoding error
    (the default of None has the same effect), or pass 'ignore' to ignore
    errors. (Note that ignoring encoding errors can lead to data loss.)
    See the documentation for codecs.register for a list of the permitted
    encoding error strings.

    newline controls how universal newlines works (it only applies to text
    mode). It can be None, '', '\n', '\r', and '\r\n'.  It works as
    follows:

    * On input, if newline is None, universal newlines mode is
      enabled. Lines in the input can end in '\n', '\r', or '\r\n', and
      these are translated into '\n' before being returned to the
      caller. If it is '', universal newline mode is enabled, but line
      endings are returned to the caller untranslated. If it has any of
      the other legal values, input lines are only terminated by the given
      string, and the line ending is returned to the caller untranslated.

    * On output, if newline is None, any '\n' characters written are
      translated to the system default line separator, os.linesep. If
      newline is '', no translation takes place. If newline is any of the
      other legal values, any '\n' characters written are translated to
      the given string.

    If closefd is False, the underlying file descriptor will be kept open
    when the file is closed. This does not work when a file name is given
    and must be True in that case.

    open() returns a file object whose type depends on the mode, and
    through which the standard file operations such as reading and writing
    are performed. When open() is used to open a file in a text mode ('w',
    'r', 'wt', 'rt', etc.), it returns a TextIOWrapper. When used to open
    a file in a binary mode, the returned class varies: in read binary
    mode, it returns a BufferedReader; in write binary and append binary
    modes, it returns a BufferedWriter, and in read/write mode, it returns
    a BufferedRandom.

    It is also possible to use a string or bytearray as a file for both
    reading and writing. For strings StringIO can be used like a file
    opened in a text mode, and for bytes a BytesIO can be used like a file
    opened in a binary mode.

    This class provides dummy implementations for many methods that
    derived classes can override selectively; the default implementations
    represent a file that cannot be read, written or seeked.

    Even though IOBase does not declare read, readinto, or write because
    their signatures will vary, implementations and clients should
    consider those methods part of the interface. Also, implementations
    may raise a IOError when operations they do not support are called.

    The basic type used for binary data read from or written to a file is
    bytes. bytearrays are accepted too, and in some cases (such as
    readinto) needed. Text I/O classes work with str data.

    Note that calling any method (even inquiries) on a closed stream is
    undefined. Implementations may raise IOError in this case.

    IOBase (and its subclasses) support the iterator protocol, meaning
    that an IOBase object can be iterated over yielding the lines in a

    encoding gives the name of the encoding that the stream will be
    decoded or encoded with. It defaults to locale.getpreferredencoding.

    errors determines the strictness of encoding and decoding (see the
    codecs.register) and defaults to "strict".

    newline can be None, '', '\n', '\r', or '\r\n'.  It controls the
    handling of line endings. If it is None, universal newlines is
    enabled.  With this enabled, on input, the lines endings '\n', '\r',
    or '\r\n' are translated to '\n' before being returned to the
    caller. Conversely, on output, '\n' is translated to the system
    default line seperator, os.linesep. If newline is any other of its
    legal values, that newline becomes the newline when the file is read
    and it is returned untranslated. On output, '\n' is converted to the
    newline.
